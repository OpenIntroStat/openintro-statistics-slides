\frametitle{An objective measure for finding the best line}

\begin{itemize}

\item We want a line that has small residuals:
\pause
\begin{enumerate}
\item Option 1: Minimize the sum of magnitudes (absolute values) of residuals
\[ |e_1| + |e_2| + \cdots + |e_n| \]
\pause
\item Option 2: Minimize the sum of squared residuals -- \hl{least squares}
\[ e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \cdots + e_n^2 \]
\end{enumerate}

\pause

\item Why least squares?
\pause
\begin{enumerate}
\item Most commonly used
\pause
\item Easier to compute by hand and using software
\pause
\item In many applications, a residual twice as large as another is usually more than twice as bad
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Conditions for the least squares line}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Linearity

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conditions: (1) Linearity}

\begin{itemize}

\item The relationship between the explanatory and the response variable should be linear. 

\pause

\item Methods for fitting a model to non-linear relationships exist, but are beyond the scope of this class. If this topic is of interest, an \href{http://www.openintro.org/download.php?file=os2_extra_nonlinear_relationships&referrer=/stat/textbook.php}{Online Extra is available on openintro.org} covering new techniques.

\pause

\item Check using a scatterplot of the data, or a \hl{residuals plot}.

\item Check using a histogram.

\formula{Intercept}
{The intercept is where the regression line intersects the $y$-axis. The calculation of the intercept uses the fact the a regression line always passes through $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$.

\pq{Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the intercept?}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item For each \% point increase in HS graduate rate, \% living in poverty is expected to increase on average by 64.68\%.
\item For each \% point decrease in HS graduate rate, \% living in poverty is expected to increase on average by 64.68\%.
\item Having no HS graduates leads to 64.68\% of residents living below the poverty line.
\solnMult{States with no HS graduates are expected on average to have 64.68\% of residents living below the poverty line.}
\item In states with no HS graduates \% living in poverty is expected to increase on average by 64.68\%.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{More on the intercept}

Since there are no states in the dataset with no HS graduates, the intercept is of no interest, not very useful, and also not reliable since the predicted value of the intercept is so far from the bulk of the data.

\subsection{Prediction \& extrapolation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Prediction}

\begin{itemize}

\item Using the linear model to predict the value of the response variable for a given value of the explanatory variable is called \hl{prediction}, simply by plugging in the value of $x$ in the linear model equation.

\item There will be some uncertainty associated with the predicted value.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Extrapolation}

\begin{itemize}

\item Applying a model estimate to values outside of the realm of the original data is called \hl{extrapolation}.

\item Sometimes the intercept might be an extrapolation.

\subsection{Using $R^2$ to describe the strength of a fit}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{$R^2$}

\begin{itemize}

\item The strength of the fit of a linear model is most commonly evaluated using \mathhl{R^2}.

\pause

\item $R^2$ is calculated as the square of the correlation coefficient.

\pause

\item It tells us what percent of variability in the response variable is explained by the model.

\pause

\item The remainder of the variability is explained by variables not included in the model or by inherent randomness in the data.

\pause

\item For the model we've been working with, $R^2 = (-0.75)^2 = 0.56$.

\end{itemize}
