\dq{How do outliers influence the least squares line in this plot?}

To answer this question think of where the regression line would be with and without the outlier(s). Without the outliers the regression line would be steeper, and lie closer to the larger group of observations. With the outliers the line is pulled up and away from some of the observations in the larger group.

\frametitle{Some terminology}
 
\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Outliers} are points that lie away from the cloud  of points.

\pause

\item Outliers that lie horizontally away from the center of the cloud are called \hl{high leverage} points.

\pause

\item High leverage points that actually influence the \underline{slope} of the regression line are called \hl{influential} points.

\pause

\item In order to determine if a point is influential, visualize the regression line with and without the point. Does the slope of the line change considerably? If so, then the point is influential. If not, then it’s not an influential point.

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Recap}

\pq{Which of following is \underline{true}?}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Influential points always change the intercept of the regression line.
\item Influential points always reduce $R^2$.
\item It is much more likely for a low leverage point to be influential, than a high leverage point.
\item When the data set includes an influential point, the relationship between the explanatory variable and the response variable is always nonlinear.
\solnMult{None of the above.}
\end{enumerate}
