\hl{Scatterplots} are useful for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables.

\begin{frame}

\dq{How would you describe the distribution of GPAs in this data set? Make sure to say something about the center, shape, and spread of the distribution.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dot plots \& mean}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{2-1_numerical_data/figures/gpa_dot_plot/gpa_dot_plot_mean}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}

\item The \hl{mean}, also called the \hl{average} (marked with a triangle in the above plot), is one way to measure the center of a \hl{distribution} of data.

\item The mean GPA is 3.59.

\end{itemize} 

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mean}

\begin{itemize}

\item The \hl{sample mean}, denoted as \mathhl{\bar{x}}, can be calculated as

\[ \bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}, \]

where $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ represent the \hl{n} observed values.

\item The \hl{population mean} is also computed the same way but is denoted as \mathhl{\mu}. It is often not possible to calculate $\mu$ since population data are rarely available.

\item The sample mean is a \hl{sample statistic}, and serves as a \hl{point estimate} of the population mean. This estimate may not be perfect, but if the sample is good (representative of the population), it is usually a pretty good estimate. 

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Stacked dot plot}

Higher bars represent areas where there are more observations, makes it a little easier to judge the center and the shape of the distribution.

\subsection{Histograms and shape}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Histograms - Extracurricular hours}

\begin{itemize}

\item Histograms provide a view of the \hl{data density}. Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common.

\item Histograms are especially convenient for describing the \hl{shape} of the data distribution.

\item The chosen \hl{bin width} can alter the story the histogram is telling.

Does the histogram have a single prominent peak (\hl{unimodal}), several prominent peaks (\hl{bimodal/multimodal}), or no apparent peaks (\hl{uniform})?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{2-1_numerical_data/figures/singleBiMultiModalUnifPlots/singleBiMultiModalUnifPlots}
\end{center}

\Note{In order to determine modality, step back and imagine a smooth curve over the histogram -- imagine that the bars are wooden blocks and you drop a limp spaghetti over them, the shape the spaghetti would take could be viewed as a smooth curve.}

\subsection{Variance and standard deviation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Variance}

\hl{Variance} is roughly the average squared deviation from the mean.

}

}



\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Variance (cont.)}

\dq{Why do we use the squared deviation in the calculation of variance?}

\soln{\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item To get rid of negatives so that observations equally distant from the mean are weighed equally.
\item To weigh larger deviations more heavily.
\end{itemize}
}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Standard deviation}

The \hl{standard deviation} is the square root of the variance, and has the same units as the data.s

\formula{
\[ s = \sqrt{s^2} \]
}

\subsection{Box plots, quartiles, and the median}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Median}

\begin{itemize}

\item The \hl{median} is the value that splits the data in half when ordered in ascending order.

\[ 0,1,\orange{2},3,4 \]

\item If there are an even number of observations, then the median is the average of the two values in the middle.

\[ 0,1,\underline{2,3},4,5 \rightarrow \frac{2 + 3}{2} = \orange{2.5} \]

\item Since the median is the midpoint of the data, 50\% of the values are below it. Hence, it is also the \hl{$50^{th}$ percentile}.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Q1, Q3, and IQR}

\begin{itemize}

\item The $25^{th}$ percentile is also called the first quartile, \hl{Q1}.

\item The $50^{th}$ percentile is also called the median.

\item The $75^{th}$ percentile is also called the third quartile, \hl{Q3}.

\item Between Q1 and Q3 is the middle 50\% of the data. The range these data span is called the \hl{interquartile range}, or the \hl{IQR}.
\formula{\[ IQR = Q3 - Q1 \]}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Box plot}

The box in a \hl{box plot} represents the middle 50\% of the data, and the thick line in the box is the median.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Whiskers and outliers}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Whiskers} of a box plot can extend up to $1.5 \times IQR$ away from the quartiles.
\formula{
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{align*} 
\text{max~upper~whisker~reach} &= Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR \\
\text{max~lower~whisker~reach} &= Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR

\text{max~lower~whisker~reach}&= 10 - 1.5 \times 10 = -5
\end{align*}
}

\pause
\vspace{-0.25cm}
\item A potential \hl{outlier} is defined as an observation beyond the maximum reach of the whiskers. It is an observation that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data.

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Robust statistics}

Median and IQR are more robust to skewness and outliers than mean and SD. Therefore,

\begin{itemize}
\item for skewed distributions it is often more helpful to use median and IQR to describe the center and spread
\item for symmetric distributions it is often more helpful to use the mean and SD to describe the center and spread

\subsection{Transforming data}

When data are extremely skewed, transforming them might make modeling easier. A common transformation is the \hl{log transformation}.
